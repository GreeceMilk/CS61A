# CS61A

This repository contains my work on [Fall 2023 offering of CS61A](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa23/). There is 10 homeworks(+ 1 course feedback hw), 13 labs, 13 discussions, and 4 projects in total.  
The 4 projects are:

- [Hog](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa23/proj/hog/): A dice game with predefined AI strategies
- [Cats](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa23/proj/cats/): A program that measures typing speed with auto-correct features
- [Ants](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa23/proj/ants/): A tower defense game similar to Plants vs Zombies
- [Scheme](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa23/proj/scheme/): A scheme interpreter built using Python

My completed projects are in the respective folders in `Project`. Although the course also touches on Scheme and SQL, all projects are written in Python.
