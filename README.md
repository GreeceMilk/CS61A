# CS61A

This repository contains my work on Fall 2023 offering of CS61A. There is 10 homeworks(+ 1 course feedback hw), 13 labs, 13 discussions, and 4 projects in total.  
The 4 projects are:

- Hog: A dice game with predefined AI strategies
- Cats: A program that measures typing speed with auto-correct features
- Ants: A tower defense game similar to Plants vs Zombies
- Scheme: A scheme interpreter built using Python

My completed projects are in the respective folders in `Project`. Although the course also touches on Scheme and SQL, all projects are written in Python.
